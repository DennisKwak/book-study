# Prototypes and Post-it Notes

## Prototype to Learn
* Prototyping is much cheaper and faster to build than full-scale production.
* Trying out risky, uncertain elements without commitment to building the real item.
* Not necessarily code based. Post-it notes, whiteboard, interface builder.
* Code can ignore important details.
* Can ignore details.

## Things to Prototype
* Anything that carries risk. Unproven, experimental, doubtful.
* Anything critical to the final system.

## How to Use Prototypes
* Can ignore: correctness, completeness, robustness, style.
* High-level scripting language.
* Use tools that allows you to focus on the appearance/interaction w/o. worrying about code/markup.

## Prototyping Architecture
* None of the individual modules in the prototype system need to be particularly functional.
* Looking for how the system hangs together as a whole (defer details).

## How Not to Use Prototypes
* Make sure that this code is disposable, incomplete, and unable to be completed.
* Do NOT deceptively attract people.

## Exercises

Marketing would like to sit down and brainstorm a few web page designs with you. They are thinking of clickable image maps to take you to other pages, and so on. But they can't decide on a model for the image - maybe it's a car, or a phone, or a house. You have a list of target pages and content; they'd like to see a few prototypes. Oh, by the way, you have 15 minues. What tools might you use?
