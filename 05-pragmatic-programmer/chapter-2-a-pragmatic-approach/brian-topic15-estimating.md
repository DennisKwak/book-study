# Estimating
## Tip 23 - estimate to Avoid Surprises
### How Accurate Is Accurate Enough?
- Do they need high accuracy, or are they looking for a ballpark figure?
- About 125 working days(25 weeks) VS About 6 months

| Duration   | Quote estimate in                    |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1–15 days  | Days                                 |
| 3–6 weeks  | Weeks                                |
| 8–20 weeks | Months                               |
| 20+ weeks  | Think hard before giving an estimate |

### Where Do Estimates Come From?
- Before we get too depply into the techniques of building models, ask someone who’s already done it.

#### Understand What's Being Asked
- Often this is implicit in the question, but you need to make it a habit to think about the scope before starting to guess. 
- Often, the scope you choose will form part of the answer you give: 
- “Assuming there are no traffic accidents and there’s gas in the car, I should be there in 20 minutes.

#### Build a Model of the System
- Building the model introduces inaccuracies into the estimating process. 
- This is inevitable, and also beneficial. You are trading off model simplicity for accuracy. 
- Doubling the effort on the model may give you only a slight increase in accuracy. 
- Your experience will tell you when to stop refining

#### Break the Model into Components
- Once you have a model, you can decompose it into components.
- You’ll find that each component will typically have parameters that affect how it contributes to the overall model. 
  - At this stage, simply identify each parameter.

#### Give Each Parameter a Value
- Once you have the parameters broken out, you can go through and assign each one a value. 
- You expect to introduce some errors in this step

#### Calculate the Answer
- Run multiple calculations, varying the values of the critical parameters, until you work out which ones really drive the model. 
- A spreadsheet can be a big help.

#### Keep Track of Your Estimating Prowess
- Record your estimates so you can see how close you were.

### Estimating Project Schedules
#### Painting the Missile
- best and worst times for the overall project
#### Eating the Elephant
- Repeating the following steps with very thin slices of functionality:
1. Check requirements
2. Analyze risk (and prioritize riskiest items earlier)
3. Design, implement, integrate
4. Validate with the users
- Unless you are doing an application similar to a previous one, with the same team and the same technology, you’d just be guessing.

## Tip 24 - Iterate the Schedule with the Code
- This may not be popular with management, who typically want a single, hard-and-fast number before the project even starts. 
- You’ll have to help them understand that the team, their productivity, and the environment will determine the schedule.

### What to Say When Asked for an Estimate
- You say “I’ll get back to you.”

### Challenges
- Start keeping a log of your estimates. 
  - For each, track how accurate you turned out to be. 
  - If your error was greater than 50%, try to find out where your estimate went wrong.
