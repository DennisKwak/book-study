# Tracer Bullets

## Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target
* Tracer bullets are loaded at intervals alongside regular ammunition. When fired, it leaves a pyrotechnic trail from the gun to to whatever they hit. Soldiers get pragmatic, real-time feedback under actual conditions and can refine their aim.

* When we develop software, we talk about hitting targets. It is important to consider _how_ to hit a target in a complex and shifting environment.

* We develop where requirements may be vague: 
* * Algorithms, techniques, languages, libraries
* * Environments may change before completion
* Use software equivalent of tracer bullets!!

## Code that GLows in the Dark

* Tracer bullets work because they operate in the same environment and under the same constraints as the real bullets.
* Use tracer code: get to the target (basic structure) fast, get immediate feedback. Gradually flesh out.
* Cheap solution from a proctical POV.
* Prioritize: areas of possible blockers, bigger risks.

## Advantages of the Tracer Code Approach
* Users get to see something working early
* Developers build a structure to work in
* You have an integration platform
* You have something to demonstrate
* You have a better feel for progress

## Tracer Bullets Don't Always Hit Their Target
* It shows you that you're hitting.
* Change what you've got to bring it nearer the target.
* A small body of code has low inertia - easy and quick to change.

## Tracer Code Vs. Prototyping
* Prototype: Exploring specific aspects of the final system. Disposable code.
* Tracer code: Knowing how the application as a whole hangs together. Architectural skeleton to hang code.
