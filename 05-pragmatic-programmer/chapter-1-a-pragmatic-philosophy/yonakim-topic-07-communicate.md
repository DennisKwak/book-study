# Communicate!
As developers, communication is crucial. From meetings, working with end users to writing proposals and code, we communicate on many levels. One tip is, treat English as just another programming language. Write natural languages as you would write code. 
* DRY principle
* ETC
* automation

## Know Your Audience
* Understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your audience.
* Gather feedback. Ask for feedback. Look for hints of feedback (i.e. body language, facial expressions).

## Know What You Want to Say
* Work out exactly what it is you want to say. 
* Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. 

## Choose Your Moment
* Work out the priorities of your audience.
* Make sure it is a good time to talk.

## Choose a Style.
* Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience.
    * Just the facts? More explanation? 
* Keep in mind your audience's skill level and experience in that area.
* However, it is also important to push ahead your style when you think it is important to do so. This is also a form of communication.

## Make it Look Good.
* Don't only concentrate on the content when writing documents.
    * Set page headers and footers.
    * Refer to sample documents. Get ideas on style and layout.
    * Check the spelling, at least twice.

## Involve your Audience
* Ask for feedback.
* Build good working relationships.

## Be a Listener
* Listen to your audience if you want to be listened.
* Ask questions, make discussions.

## Get Back to People.
* Respond to emails and voicemails. Even "I'll get back to you later." is okay.
* Keep people informed. Show sign of life.

## Documentation
* Pragmatic Programmers must embrace documentation as an internal part of the overall development process.
* Add comments to modules and exported functions.
* However do not violate the DRY principle.
* Comment source code (i.e. engineering trade-offs, why decisions were made, what alternatives were discarded).
