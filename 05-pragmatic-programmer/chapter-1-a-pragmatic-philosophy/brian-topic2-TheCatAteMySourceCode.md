# The Cat Ate My Source Code

### The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.
- Ignorance and errors can happen, we try to deal with them as professionally as we can. 
- It means being honest and direct.

## Team Trust
- In a healthy environment based in trust, you can safely speak your mind, present your ideas, and rely on your team
- A breach of trust might be hard to repair. 

## Take Responsibility
- You'll have to make the call based on your own values and judgment.
1. When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome,
   - you should expect to be held accountable for it.
2. When you make a mistake(as we all do) or an error in judgment,
   - admit it honestly and try to offer options.

### Tip 4 - Provide options, don't make lame excuses
- Does your any excuse sound reasonable, or stupid?
- How's it going to sound to your boss?
- Your boss could say "Have you tried this..." or "Didn't you consider that?"

### Instead of excuses, provide options. -> Don't be afraid to ask
- Refactoring
- Prototyping
- Better testing
- Automation
- Additional resources
- more time
- or just you
  - learning technique or technology -> book or course

## Challenges
1. How do you react when someone comes to you with a lame excuse? What do you think of them and their company as a result?
2. When you find yourself saying, "I don't know," be sure to follow it up with "- but I'll find out." It's a great way to admit what you don't know, but then take responsibility like a pro.
