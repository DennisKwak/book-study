# Software Entropy

- When disorder increases in software,
  - we call it "Software rot" or "Technical debt"
  - and we probably won't pay it back someday.

## Ruined or Decayed Project VS Successful Project with Entropy

### Tip 5 - Don't Live with Broken Windows
- Hopelessness can be contagious
- Fix each one(bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code) as soon as it is discovered.
- Neglect accelerates the rot faster than any other factor.

## First, Do No Harm
- Even if there is a raging(dedline, release date, trade show demo, etc.),
  - You don't want to be the first one to make a mess and inflict additional damage.

## Broken Windows VS First, Do No Harm
- One broken window is one too many.
- It's all too easy to slip into the mindset of "All the rest of this code is crap"
- By the same token, you could just tell yourself, "No broken windows."

## Challenges
1. Help strengthen your team by surveying your project neighborhood. Choose two or three broken windows and discuss with your colleagues what the problems are and what could be done to fix them.
2. Can you tell when a window first gets broken? What is your reaction? If it was the result of someone else's decision, or a management edict, what can you do about it?
