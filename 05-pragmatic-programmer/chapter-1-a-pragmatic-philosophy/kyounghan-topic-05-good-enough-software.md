# Good-Enough Software

## Old joke about a company 
- Order for 100,000 ICs, defect rate one chip in 10,000
- On large box containing thousands of ICs and a samll one containing just ten.
- But almost not possible in reality, considering time, technology and temperament 


## But don't need to be frustrating
- When good-enough software is best[You95], an article in IEEE software, Ed Yourdon
- you can discipline yourself to write software that's good enough for users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind

## What's the 'Good Enough'
- Not imply sloppy or poorly
- All System must meet 
    - their users' requirements to be successful
    - basic performance
    - privacy
    - security standards
- Users should be given an opportunity to participate in the process of deciding when what you've produced is good enough for their needs.

## Scope, Quality and Trade-off
- Sometimes, depends on the software, like pacemakers, an autopilot, or a low-level library, options are limited
- But if you're working on a brand-new product, you'll have different constraints.
    - Marketing people's promise
    - plans based on a delivery schedule
    - cashflow constraints
- It would be unprofessional to ignore all these requirements or aceept all of them
> Make Quality a Requirements Issue
- Many users would rather use software with some rough edges today than wait a year for the shiny, bell-and-whistles version
- Great Software today is often preferable to the fantasy of perfect software tomorrow.
- Feedback makes better eventual solution

## Know when to stop
- In some ways, programming is like painting
- Sketch out an overall shape, paint the underlying environment, then fill in the details
- Constantly step back with a critical eye to view whant you've done
- Hard work would be ruined if you don't know when to stop
- Don't spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and overrefinement
- It may not be perfect, Don't worry, it would never be perfect
