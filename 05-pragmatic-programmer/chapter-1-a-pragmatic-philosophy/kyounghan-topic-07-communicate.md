# Communicate!

Having the best ideas, the finest code, or the most pragmatic thinking is multimately sterile unless
you can communicate with other people. 

As developers, we have to communicate on many levels
- Meetings
- Work with end users
- By writing code, documenting with a machine and furture gnenerations of developers

## Know your audience
- Need to understand the needs, interests and capabilities of your audience
- You can present new feature / update in many different ways, depending on your audience
- End users / Marketing department / Development and operations managers / Developers ...

## Know what you want to say
- It's difficult to know exactly what you want to say yourself
- Plan what you want to say
- Write an outline
- "Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them?


## Choose your moment
- Need to find out what their priorites are

## Choose a style
- Depends on the audience, adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience
- formal briefing / wide-ranging chat before getting down to business
- Expers / Newbies ...

## Make it look good
- Your ideas are important and they deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your audience.
- Many devlopers concentrate solely on content when producing written docuemtns
- This is a mistake

## Involve your audience
- Involve your readers with early drafts of your document.
- Get their feedback
- Building a good working relationship

## Be a listener
- Be a listner
- Turn the meeting into a dialog.

## Get back to people
- Always respond to emails and voicemails, even if the reponse is simply "I'll get back to you later."
- Keeping poeple informed makes them far more forgiving of the occasional slip and makes them feel that you haven't forgotten them.

## Documentation
- Embrace documentation as an integral part of the overall development process.
- Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effort or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand - n the code itself.
