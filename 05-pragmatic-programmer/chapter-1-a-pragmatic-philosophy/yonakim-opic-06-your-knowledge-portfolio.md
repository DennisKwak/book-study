# Your Knowledge Portfolio
Knowledge and experience are the most important day-to-day professional assets for developpers.Unfortunately, these are _expiring_ assets. Knowledge becomes out of date as new techniques, languages, and environments come up. 

As the value of one's knowledge declines, so does their value to their company or client. Thus the ability to learn new things is the most important strategic asset.

How to manage a knowledge portfolio:
* Invest regularly as a habit
    * Even if it's just a small amount. 

* Diversification is the key to long term success.
    * The more different things you know, the mor valuable you are. Don't stop on only knowing the particular technology you are currently working with. 
    * Investing in soft skills is also very important.

* Smart investors balance their portfolios between cocnservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.
    * Don't put all your technical eggs in one basket.

* Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return. 
    * Some seemingly undervalued stock may payoff high later. 

* Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.
    * This is a very dynamic industry.

## Goals
* Learn at least one new language every year.
    * You will learn how to solve the same problem in different ways. Broaden your thinking. 

* Read a technical book each month.
    * On technlogies you are currently using
    * On topics that don't relate to your project.
    * Read non-technical books to. Understand the human side of the equation. 

* Take classes.

* Participate in local user groups and meetups
    * Isolation is deadly to your career.

* Experiment with different environments.
    * i.e. window -> Linux
    * makefiles -> sophisticated IDE

* Stay current
    * Find out other people's interest and experiences
    * Be familiar with particular jargon they use.

* Open yourself to new possibilities and new ways of doing things. 

* Cross-pollination of ideas: apply the lessons you've learned to your current project.

## Opportunities for Learning
* Build your network
* Plan ahead. Time management is key.

## Critical Thinking
* Ensure your knowledge in your portfolio is accurate
* Never underestimate the power of commercialism.
* Dive deep.
* Ask _"Why?"_, _"Who does this benefit?"_, _"What's the context?"_, _"When or where would this work?"_, _"Why is this a problem?"_
