# Pragmatic Teams

* Can pragmatic techniques that help an individual be a better programmer work for teams as well, even for teams of strong-willed, independent people?
* Yes! The advantages are maltiplied manyfold if the individual is working on a pragmatic team.

* A team is a small, mostly stable entity of its own 
    * Under 10-12 members
    * two-pizza rule?

## No Broken Windows
* Quality is a team issue.
* Teams as a whole should not tolerate broken windows - those small imperfections that no one fixes.

* The idea of a "quality officer" is ridiculous: quality can come only from the individual contributions of _all_ team members. Quality is built in, not bolted on!

## Boiled Frogs
* The apocryphal frog in the pan of water - same thing can happen to individuals who aren't vigilant. 
    * Assume someone else is handling an issue
    * Need team leader's approval
    * Oblivious to significant changes in their project

* Fight this!
    * Everyone should actively monitor the environment for changes
    * Be aware of increased scope, decreased time scales, additional features, new environments
    * Keep metrics on new requirements

## Schedule Your Knowledge Portfolio
* NO getting things done "whenever there's a free moment"
* Do not reserve backlog items for only feature development
    * Old Systems Maintenance
    * Process Reflection and Refinement
    * New tech experiments
    * Learning and skill improvements

## Communicate Team Presence
* Not only should developers talk to each other, but also communicate with the rest of the world.
* Never be sullen and reticent - meatings with no structure, messy emails and project documents.
* Great project teams have a distinct personality. Generate a brand!
    * Come up with a off-the-wall name for your project.
    * Come up with a zany logo.
    * Use your team's name liberally when talking with people. Give your team an identity to build on, and the world something memorable to associate with your work.

## Don't Repeat Yourselves
* Good communication (_instant_ and _frictionless_) is key to avoid repetition. 
    * Be able to ask a question and get an instant reply.
    * Easy and low-ceremony to ask questions, share progress/problems, and stay aware of what your teammates are doing.

* Maintain awareness to stay DRY.

## Team Tracer Bullets
* A project team has to accomplish many different tasks
    * Understand requirements
    * Design architecture
    * Code for frontend and server
    * Testing
* These activities cannot happen separately in isolation!
* This approach introduces _gates_ and _handoffs_. Artificial gates where the work stops.
    * Wait time for approvals
    * Paperwork

* Develop individual features - small and limited initially - that go end-to-end through the entire system. You'll need all the skills to do that within the team.
* Implement small bits of functionality quickly, and get immediate feedback on how well your team communicates and delivers.

> Tip 86: Organize Fully Functional Teams

* Build teams so you can build code end-to-end, incrementally and iteratively.

## Automation
* Great way to ensure consistency and accuracy.
* Essential component of every project team.

## Know When To Stop Adding Paint
* Give each team member the ability to shine in their own way.
* Give them just enough structure to support them and to ensure that the project delivers value.
* Resist the temptation to add more paint.

## Challenges

* Look around for successful teams outside the area of software development. What makes them successful? Do they use any of the processes discussed in this section?

* Next time you start a project, try convincing people to brand it. Give your organization time to become used to the idea, and then do a
quick audit to see what difference it made, both within the team and externally.

* You were probably once given problems such as “If it takes 4 workers 6 hours to dig a ditch, how long would it take 8 workers?”
In real life, however, what factors affect the answer if the workers were writing code instead? In how many scenarios is the time actually reduced?
