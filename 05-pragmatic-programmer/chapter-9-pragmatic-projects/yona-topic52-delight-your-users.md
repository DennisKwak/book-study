# Delight Your Users

* Our goal as developers is to _delight users_.
* Users are not particularly delighed by code, they may not have software related expectations.
    * They have business problems to solve.
    * They care about their objectives and budget.

* So what? Always ask:
```
"How will you know that we've all been successful a month (or a year, or whatever) after this project is done?"
```
* It's the expectations of business balue that really count. The software is only a means to these ends.
    * A project to improve product recommendations might be judged in terms of customer retention.
    * A project to consolidate two databases might be judged in terms of data quality.

* Think about how you can deliver against them:
    * Make sure everyone on the team is clear about the expectations.
    * Think about which path forward moves closer to those expectations when making decisions.
    * Critically analyze the user requirements in light of the expectations.
        * Don't be afraid of making suggestions that might change the requirement if you think that they will move the project closer to the objective.
    * Continue to think about these expectations as you progress through the project.

* As our knowledge of the domain increases, we're better able to make suggestions on other things that could be done to address the underlying business issues.

> Tip 96: Delight Users, Don't Just Deliver Code

* Forge a relationship with your client. Actively help solve their problems.

* A "Software Developer" should be a "Problem Solver".
