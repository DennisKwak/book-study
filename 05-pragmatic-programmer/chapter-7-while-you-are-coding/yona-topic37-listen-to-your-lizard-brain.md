# Listen to Your Lizard Brain

* As sophisticated humans we have learned to ignore our more animal side - our sinstincs, our lizard brain.
* Instincts are a response to patterns packed into our nonconscious brain. 
* As you gain experience as a programmer, you get instincts on things that will work, things that may not work, the probable cause of a type of error, etc.
    * Hits _save key_ when you stop to chat with someone. 

* Instints make you feel, not think. 
* Notice it is happening, and then work out why!!

## Fear of the Blank Page

* Starting a new project can be an unnerving experience.
* You might be afraid that you'll make a mistake.
    * We often take errors in code as reflections on our competence.
    * Element of imposter syndrome?
* When you feel a nagging doubt, heed it. 
    * Take time to think and your doubts will probably turn out into something you can address.
    * Let your instincts contribute to your performance.

## Fighting Yourself
* When your lizard brain is sensing feedback from the code, listen!

## How to Talk lizard

1. Stop what you're doing. Give yourself a little time and space to let your brain organize itself. 
    * Get away from your keyboard.
    * Let the ideas percolate up through the layers of your brain on their own.

2. Try externalizing the issue.
    * Explain it to a coworker.
    * Rubber ducking.

3. Tell your brain that what you're about to do doesn't matter. Time for prototyping!

## It's Playtime!

* Tell yourself you need to prototype something.
* Look for some aspects of the project that you want to explore.
    1. Write "I'm prototyping" on a sticky note, and stick it on the side of your screen.
    2. Remind yourself that prototypes are meant to fail. And remind yourself that prototypes get thrown away, even if they don't fail. There is no downside to doing this.
    3. In your empty editor buffer, create a comment describing in one sentence what you want to learn or do.
    4. Start coding.

* If, in the middle of prototyping, your doubt suddenly crystallizes into a solid concern, address it.
* If you're still uneasy, start again with taking time off.

## Not Just _Your_ Code
* We often deal with existing code, written by other people.
    * When you spot things done in a way that seems strange, jot it down.
    * Look for patterns. 
    * Try to see what drove them to write code that way.

* You might learn something new!

## Not Just Code
* Can apply to the bigger picture. 
    * A design feels wrong.
    * Some requirements makes you feel uneasy.

* Stop and analyze these feelings. 
* Talk to peers.
* Explore them. 

* Listen to your instincts and avoid the problem before it jumps out at you.
