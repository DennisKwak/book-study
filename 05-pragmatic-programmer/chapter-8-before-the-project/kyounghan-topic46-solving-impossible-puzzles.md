# Solving Impossible Puzzles

## Story of Alexander the Great
- Gordius, the King of Phrygia, once tied a knot that no one could untie.
- It was said that whoever solved the riddle of the Gordian Knot would rule all of Asia.
- Alexander chops the knot to bits with his sword.
- Just a little different interpretation of the requirements. 

## Hard puzzle to solve
- Some piece of engineering that you just can't get a handle on, or perhaps some bit of code that is turning out to be much harder to write than you thought.
- Maybe it looks impossible.

## Solving real-world-puzzles
### People tend to try like below
- Many puzzles looks not easy to solve at first try.
- But even though it's obvious, that doesn't stop people from trying the same thing 
- Over and over - thinking there must be a way and of course, there isn't

### How to solve puzzle?
- The secret to solving the puzzle is to identify the real constraints and find a solution therein
- Some constraints are absolute
- Other are merely preconceived notions
- Absolute constraints must be honored, however distateful or stupid they may appear to be

### What did Alexander prove
- Alexander proved, some apparent constraints may not be real constraints at all.
- Many software problems can be just as sneaky
  
## Degrees of Freedom
### Popular buzz-phrase "thinking outside the box"
- Encourage us to recognize constraints that might not be applicable and to ignore them
- But what is the box?
- If the "box" is the boundary of constraints and conditions, then the trick is to find the box
- Which may be considertably larger than you think.  

### Key to solving puzzle
- To recongnize the constraints
- To recognize the degrees of freedom you do have
- Challenge any preconceived notions and evaluate whether or not they are real, hard-and-fast constraints.
- The problem lies in finding the box
  - It's not whether you think inside the box or outside the box.
  - Identifying the real contraints

### When faced with an intractable problem
- Enumerate all the possible avenues you have before you
- Don't dismiss anything, no matter how unusable or stupid it sounds
- Go through the list and explain why a certain path cannot be taken
- **Trojan horse**
    - A novel solution to an intractable problem
    - How do you get troops into a walled city without being discovered?
    - The idea "through the front door" would be easy to be dismissed.

### Handle constraints
- Categorize and prioritize the contraints
- ** Woodworkers**
  - When woodworkers begin a project, they cut the longest pieces first, then cut the smaller pieces out of the reaminging wood.
- Identify the most restrictive constraints first, and fit the remaining constraints within them


## Get Out of Your Own Way!
### When stuck in some problem
- Sometimes you will find yourself working on a problem that seems much harder than you though
- That there must be an easier way than this!
- This is an ideal time to do something else for a while
  - Work on something different
  - Go walk the dog. 
  - Sleep on it
- Give some time to your brain
- Associative neural net lurks below your consciousness, some space and then answer will just pop into your head when you deliberately distract yourself.
- **Psycology Today**

### Next method to get out in stuck situation
- Finding someone to explain the problem 
- Often, the distraction of simply talking about it will lead you to enlightnment
- Ask questions like below 
    - Why are you solving this problem?
    - What's the benefit of solving it?
    - Are the problems you're having related to edge case? Can you eliminate them?
    - Is there a simpler, related probem you can solve?

## Fortune Favors the Prepared Mind
- Louis Pasteur is reported to have said
  - When it comes to observation, fortune favors the prepared mind.
- That is true for problem solving
- Your nonconscious brain needs to have plenty of raw material
  - Prior experiences that can contribute to an answer
- A great way to feed your brain
  - To give feedback on what works and what doesn't work as you do your daily job
  - As described in Topic 22, Engineering Daybooks
- *DON'T PANIC*

## Challenges

- Take a hard look at whatever difficult problem you are embroiled in today. Can you cut the Gordian knot? Do you have to do it this way? Do you have to do it at all?
- Were you handed a set of constraints when you signed on to your current project? Are they still applicable, and is the interpretation of them still valid?
