# Working Together

## Impossible Project
### Hard requirements
- Ridiculous deadline
- Massive requirement but requirements are often undocumented

### How could the project success
- The expert who had managed this system for years was sitting right there.
- Continuously available for questions, clarifications, decisions and demos.

### Working closely with Users
- This is recommendation throughtout this book
- Pair programming or mob programming
- One person typing code while one or more other team members comment, ponder, and solve problems together
- It's powerful way of working together
  - It transcends endless meeting, memos, and overstuffed legalistic documentations
- Not working together
  - Just asking questions
  - having discussions
  - taking notes
- Asking questions and having discussions while you're actually coding

### Conway's Law
- How do Committee Invent? [Con68]
- Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.
- Studies also offer support for the reverse principle.

## Pair Programming
### What is pair programming
- One of the practices of eXtreme Programming, become popular outside of XP itself.
- One developer operates the keyboard, the other does not.
- Both work on the problem together, and can switch typing duties as needed

### Benefits of Pair Programming
- Different people bring different backgrounds and experience
  - Different problem solving techniques and approaches and differing levels of focus and attention 
- Two role of each developer
  - The developer acting as typist
    - Must focus on the low-level details of syntax and coding style
  - The other developer
    - Consider higher-level issues and scope
- The inherent peer-pressure of a second person helps against moments of weakness and had habits of naming variables and such.
- Less inclined to take a potentially embarrassing shortcut when someone is actively watching, which also results in higher-quality software

## Mob Programming
### More than two?
- It two heads are better than one, what about having a dozen diverse people all working on the same problem at the same time, with one typist?

#### Whaht is mob programming
- Does not involve torches or pitchforks
- It's extension of pair programming that involves more than just two developers

### Feature of mob programming
- Mobs can easily include people not usually considered part of the development team, including users, project sponsors, and testers
- The 'impossible' project
  - It was a common sight for one of us to be typing while the other discussed the issue with our business expert.
  - The small mob of three.
- Tight collaboration with live coding

## What Should I Do?
### Try pair programming
- Minimum of two weeks, only a few hours at a time => as it will feel strange at first.
- To brainstorm new ideas or diagnose thorny issues, perhaps try a mob programming session 

### Other aspects to be considered, not just technical aspect for pair/mob programming
#### Tips to get start
- Build the code, not your ego. It's not about who's brightest; we all have our moments, good and bad.
- Start small. Mob with only 4-5 people, or start with just a few pairs, in short sessions.
- Criticize to code, not the person
- Listen and try to understand others' viewpoints. Different isn't wrong.
- Conduct frequent retrospectives to try and improve for next time.

### Try other ways
- Coding in the same office or remote, alone , in pairs, or in mobs, are all effective ways of working together to solve problem
- If you and your team have only ever done it one way, you might want to experiment with a different style.
- But don't jump in with a navie approach
  - There are rules, suggestions, and guidelines for each of these development styles.
  - In mob programming you swap out the typist ever 5-10 minutes
- Do some reading and research 
  - Textbook and experience reports
