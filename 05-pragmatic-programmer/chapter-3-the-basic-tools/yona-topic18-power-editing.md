# Power Editing

Fun fact: Over the course of a year, you might actually gain an additional week if you make your editing just 4% more efficient and you edit for 20 hours a week!

## Achieve Editor Fluency
* Editors are one of the most important software tools.
* Become fluent, to a point you no longer have to think about the mechanics of editing.

## Some shortcuts

## Moving Toward Fluency
* Learn the commands that make your life easier.
* When you find yourself doing something repetitive, find a "better way".
* Get the features installed into your muscle memory.

## Growing Your Editor
* Start with editors built around basic core.
* When you find some limitation of the editor, search for an extension.
* Dig into the editor's extension language. Work out how to automate your repetitive work.
* bashrc / zshrc

## Challenges
* No more autorepeat. 
Everyone does it: you need to delete the last word you typed, so you press down on 'backspace' and wait for autorepeat to kick in. In fact, we bet that your brain has done this so much that you can judge pretty much exactly when to release the key.
So turn off autorepeat, and instead learn the key sequences to move, select, and delete by characters, words, lines, and blocks.

* This one is going to hurt.
Lose the mouse/trackpad. For one whole week, edit using just the keyboard. You'll discover a bunch of stuff that you can't do without pointing and clicking, so now's the time to learn. Keep notes (we recommend going old-school and using pencil and paper) of the key sequences you learn.
You'll take a productivity hit for a few days. But, as you learn to do stuff without moving your hands away from the home position, you'll find that your editing becomes faster and more fluent than it ever was in the past.

* Look for integrations. While writing this chapter, Dave wondered if he could preview the final layout (a PDF file) in an editor buffer. One download later, the layout is sitting alongside the original text, all in the editor. Keep a list of things you'd like to bring into your editor, then look for them.

* Somewhat more ambitiously, if you can't find a plugin or extension that does what you want, write one. Andy is fond of making custom, local file-based Wiki plugins for his favorite editors. If you can't find it, build it!
