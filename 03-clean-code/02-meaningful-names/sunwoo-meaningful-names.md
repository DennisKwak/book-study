# Meaningful Names

* The scope of names in software development is large, including variables, functions, arguments, classes, packages, directories and files.
* The name should tell engineers why it exists, what it does, how it is used. 
* For names, we need to try to avoid some ambiguous words which can be interpreate in different ways.
* For names, create name with meaningful distinction and without noise word (an, data, object, function)
* Using pronounceable name enhence the communication between engineers and engineer's cognition
* To maximize the utility of IDE, if you use more searchable word, we can get the reference more effectively.
* Don't put any information in name, which can be inffered by other attributes. (In java, using `firstName` instead of `strFirstName`)
* Class name should include noun or noun phrase name ,and should not include abstract words(manager, processor, data) and verb
* Mehtod name shoud include verb or verb pharse name.
* Don't use cultural dependent word instead use intuitive word
* In the team level, share the one word for each concept
* You can use technical terms to identify for better understands for programmers
* Include problem domain into the name, so programmer can identify the domain of usages.
* Add the context of usages for the names (firstName -> addrFirstName: the first name in address context)
* Do not add the context which is too broad; it becomes meaningless
* Choosing a name requires for programmer to have descriptive skills and shared cultural background.
