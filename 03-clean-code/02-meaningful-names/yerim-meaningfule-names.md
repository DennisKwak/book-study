# 2. Meaningful Names
### Introduction
We'd better do it well because We do so much of it.

### Use Intention-Revealing Names
Choosing names that reveal intent can make it much easier to understand and change code.

### Avoid Disinformation
- Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`.
- Beware of using names which vary in small ways.
- Spelling similar concepts similarly is information.

### Make Meaningful Distinctions
Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.

### Use pronounceable Names
If you can't pronounce it, you can't discuss it without sounding like an idiot.

### Use Searchable Names
Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text.

### Avoid Encoding
Encoded names are seldom pronounceable and are easy to mis-type.

### Hungarian Notation
They make it harder to change the name or type of a variable, function, or class. They make it harder to read the code. And they create the possibility that the encoding system will mislead the reader.

### Member Prefixes
Your classes and functions should be small enough that you don't need them. And you should be using an editing environment that highlights or colorizes members to make them distinct.

### Interfaces and Implementations
Leave interfaces unadorned.

### Avoid Mental Mapping
Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.

### Class Names
Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names. A class name should not be a verb.

### Method Names
Methods should have verb or verb phrase names.

### Don't Be Cute
Cuteness in code often appears in the form of colloquialisms or slang. Say what you mean. Mean what you say.

### Pick One Word per Concept
A consistent lexicon is a great boon to the programmers who must use your code.

### Don't pun
Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun.

### Use Solution Domain Names
Choosing technical names for those things is usually the most appropriate course.

### Use Problem Domain Names
The code that has more to do with problem domain concepts should have names drawn from the problem domain.

### Add Meaningful Context
You need to place names in context for your reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, or namespaces. When all else fails, then prefixing the name may be necessary as a last resort.

### Don't Add Gratuitous Context
Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.

### Final Words
The hardest thing about choosing good names is that it requires **good descriptive skills and a shared cultural background**.
