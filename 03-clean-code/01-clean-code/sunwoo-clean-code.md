# Clean Code

* As the software industry has been growing, the layer of abstraction for software has been increased. Software engineer now required to write the code with specific languages or frameworks for each domain.
* In the business perspective, the bad code (mess codebase) is a critical risk which has the potential to bring the business down.
* In the engineer perspective, there is a bad cycle to decrease the engineer's productivity (small mess in codebase -> decrease productivity -> more mess in codebase)
* Redesigning a system is one of option to approach to the mess in the codebase, which costs a lot of resources like number of engineers and time
* The software development is a social activity, and one of the responsibility for software engineer is to let their managers or other departmenets the information of the progress in software engineer (ex. potential risk for mess)
* The only way to go fast for software development is to keep the codebase as clean as possible.
* The clean code has the following characteristics: pleasing to read, concrete abstraction, easy to modify and simple. 
* the task for clean code is not only about to write clean code, but also about maintainence.
