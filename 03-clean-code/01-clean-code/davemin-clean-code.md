## 1. Clean Code

### Two Reasons
    1. You are a programmer
    2. You want to bre a better programmer

### There will be code 
    we will never eliminate necessary precision—so there will always be code. 

### Bad Code
    It can bring the company down
  
**why?**

haste? pressure from one's boss? Tired of programming?
 
	
### Attitue 
    Like professional(Pro) eg. Doctor vs patient - stop washing hands?
  So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.

### The Primal Conundrum
    only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

### What Is Clean Code?

**1. Elegance & Efficient**

    Clean code is pleasing to read.  	
    Wasted cycles are inelegant, they are not pleasing.

**2. Simple, derent, prose**

    Clean code is simple and direct.    
    Clean code reads like well-written prose.

**3. Literate**

    Clean code can be read - meaningful name, unit and acceptance tests     
    Small code is better -  minimal dependencies, clear and minimal API

**4. Care**

    Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.

**5. Small, expressive, simple : No duplication, one thing, expressiveness, tiny abstractions.**

	• Runs all the tests;
	• Contains no duplication;
	• Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system;
	• Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.

**6. What you expected**

    You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected.
  

**7. The Boy Scout Rule**

    Leave the campground cleaner than you found it. 
    If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot.

### Conclusion
  You will learn the thought processes of good programmers and the tricks, techniques, and tools that they use.
