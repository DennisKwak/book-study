# 1. Scale From zero to Milions of Users
## (1) Single Server Setup


### - A single server setup (fg1-1)

Everything is running on one server( web app, database, cache, etc )
![This is an alt text.](image_dave/fg1-1.jpg)


### - Request Flow & Traffic source

#### *Request Flow (fg1-2)*
```
1. Ïú†Ï†Ä ÎèÑÎ©îÏù∏Î™Ö Ï†ëÏÜç (DNS(Domain name service)Îäî 3rd partyÎ•º ÌÜµÌïú Ïú†Î£åÏÑúÎπÑÏä§)

```
1. web application: ÎëêÍ∞úÏùò combination Íµ¨ÏÑ±

 - front-side languages(HTML and JavaScript) for presentation

## (2) Database (multiple server case)

Say multiple servers are needed with the growth of the user base now.

Separating web/mobile traffic (web tier) and database (data tier)ÏùÑ Ïù¥Ïö©Ìïú ÎèÖÎ¶ΩÏ†Å ÌôïÏû•

![fg1-3](image_dave/fg1-3.jpg)

Which databases to use(Relational database vs Non-relational database)?

#### *Relational database*
```
- called RDBMS(Relational database management system) or SQL database
- i.e.) MySQL, Oracle database, PostgreSQL, etc.
- data in tables and rows
- SQL join operations(O)

When to use?
 All cases except for the NoSQL database cases below
```

#### *Non-relational database*
```
- called NoSQL databases
- i.e.) CouchDB, Neo4j, Cassandra, HBase, Amazon DynamoDB, etc.
- four categories: key-value stores, graph stores, column stores, and document stores
- join operations(SQL) across different database tables
- SQL join operations(X)

When to use?
‚Ä¢ Your application requires super-low latency(minimal delay).
‚Ä¢ Your data are unstructured, or you do not have any relational data.
‚Ä¢ You only need to serialize and deserialize data (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.).
‚Ä¢ You need to store a massive amount of data.
```

## (3) Vertical scaling vs horizontal scaling
#### *Vertical Scaling*üëé
```
- called ‚Äúscale up‚Äù
- more power (CPU, RAM, etc.) to your servers
- When traffic is low

But, Serious limitations
 ‚Ä¢ No unlimited CPU and memory to a single server.
 ‚Ä¢ No failover(Ïû•Ïï†Ï°∞Ïπò) and redundancy(ÏÑúÎ≤ÑÎã§Ï§ëÌôî). i.e. Server downüò¥ -> Website/App downüò±
```

#### *horizontal Scaling*üëç
```
- called  ‚Äúscale-out‚Äù
- more servers into your pool of resources
- ‚úî More Desirable for Large-Scale Applications( Due to the Vertical Scaling limit)
```

In the single server design(users -> the web server directly),

 case 1. Web server offline -> No user access
 
 case 2. Many users access simultaneously ->  Web server‚Äôs Load Limit -> Lower Response or Fail Response
 
To address this issue? Answer: **Load balancer.**
 
## (4) Load balancer - Web tier
: To distribute incoming traffic among web servers

![fg1-4](image_dave/fg1-4.jpg)

```
the public IP(from user) -> Load balancer (Web server is unreachable directly by users)
Then,
separated to private IPs
- same network b/w servers
- not on the internet
- communication only through the private IPs.
```

one more server and load balancer(Web tier) -> no failover issue
```
‚Ä¢ server 1 offline -> routed to server 2
: This prevents the website from going offline. 
‚Ä¢ website traffic grows rapidly -> two servers are not enough 
: Adding more servers, then the load balancer automatically will handle them.
```

>One database does not support failover and redundancy. Database replication is a common technique to address those problems.

## (5) Database replication(DBÎ≥µÏ†ú) - data tier
Database replication can be used in many database management systems. 

A representative case is a master/slave relationship between the original (master) and the copies (slaves).

#### *Master/Slave DB replication*
```
Master DB
‚Ä¢ Write operations(insert, delete, or update) only

Slave DB
‚Ä¢ Read operations only

Read > Write (A higher ratio of Read operations to Write operations)
Therefore,
Slave DB > Master DB ( the number of Slave DB is larger than the number of Master DB )
```
![fg1-5](image_dave/fg1-5.jpg)

#### *Advantages of database replication:*
```
‚Ä¢ Better performance: 
  all Writes/Updates -> master nodes
  all Read -> slave nodes
  Therefore, More queries in parallel (higher performance)
  
‚Ä¢ Reliability: 
  Say your database servers get destroyed (natural disaster: typhoon, earthquake, etc.) 
  Data is still preserved. No data loss! By DB replication across multiple locations.

‚Ä¢ High availability: 
  Again, say your database servers are offline (natural disaster: typhoon, earthquake, etc.) 
  Users can still access the website and the data stored! By DB replication across multiple locations.
```

#### *High availability - DB replication:* 

>What if one of the databases goes offline? 

#### *If only one slave database is available:* 
```
‚Ä¢ read operations will be directed to the master database temporarily
‚Ä¢ As soon as the issue is found, a new slave database will replace the old one
```
#### *If multiple slave databases are available:* 
```
‚Ä¢ read operations are redirected to other healthy slave databases
‚Ä¢ A new database server will replace the old one
```
#### *If the master database goes offline:* 
```
‚Ä¢ A slave database will be promoted to be the new master
‚Ä¢ All the database operations will be temporarily executed on the new master database
‚Ä¢ A new slave database will replace the old one for data replication immediately

#note
In production systems, promoting a new master is more complicated as the data in a slave database might not be up to date.
The missing data needs to be updated by running data recovery scripts.
Although some other replication methods like multi-masters and circular replication could help, those setups are more complicated.
```
## Load balancer(Web tier) + Database replication(data tier, DBÎ≥µÏ†ú)
ÎëêÍ∞úÏùò Ï°∞Ìï©(Load balancer(Web tier) + Database replication) 

![fg1-6](image_dave/fg1-6.jpg)
```
‚Ä¢ A user gets the IP address of the load balancer from DNS.
‚Ä¢ A user connects the load balancer with this IP address.
‚Ä¢ The HTTP request is routed to either Server 1 or Server 2.
‚Ä¢ A web server reads user data from a slave database.
‚Ä¢ A web server routes any data-modifying operations to the master database(write/update/delete operations).
```

## (6) Cache
To improve the load/response time, add a cache layer and shift static content (JavaScript/CSS/image/video files) to the content delivery network (CDN).

## (7) Content delivery network (CDN)
## (8) Stateless web tier
## (9) Data centers
## (10) Message queue
## (11) Logging, metrics, automation
## (12) Database scaling
