# CHAPTER 3: A FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEWS
```
The system design interview simulates real-life problem solving
where two co-workers collaborate on an ambiguous problem and come up with a solution that meets their goals.
The problem is open-ended, and there is no perfect answer.

The final design is less important compared to the work you put in the design process.

This allows you to demonstrate your design skill, defend your design choices, and respond to feedback in a constructive manner.

The primary goal of the interviewer is to accurately assess your abilities.
The last thing she wants is to give an inconclusive evaluation because the session has gone poorly and there are not enough signals.
What is an interviewer looking for in a system design interview?
Many think that system design interview is all about a person's technical design skills.
It is much more than that.

An effective system design interview gives strong signals about a person's ability to collaborate, to work under pressure,
and to resolve ambiguity constructively.
The ability to ask good questions is also an essential skill, and many interviewers specifically look for this skill.
A good interviewer also looks for red flags.
Over-engineering is a real disease of many engineers as they delight in design purity and ignore tradeoffs.
They are often unaware of the compounding costs of over-engineered systems, and many companies pay a high price for that ignorance.

You certainly do not want to demonstrate this tendency in a system design interview.
Other red flags include narrow mindedness, stubbornness, etc.

In this chapter, we will go over some useful tips and
introduce a simple and effective framework to solve system design interview problems.
```

## A 4-step process for effective system design interview
```
 open-ended 
 no one-size-fits-all solution. 
 However, there are steps and common ground to cover in every system design interview.
```

#### Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope
```
ü•µüôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è giving out an answer quickly without thinking gives you no bonus points. -> huge red flag
```
> üòâ Slow down. Think deeply and ask questions to clarify requirements and assumptions. This is extremely important. 

Gathering all the information is needed to build a system. So, do not be afraid to ask questions.

##### Here is a list of questions to help you get started:
```
‚Ä¢ What specific features are we going to build?
‚Ä¢ How many users does the product have?
‚Ä¢ How fast does the company anticipate to scale up? What are the anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months, and a year?
‚Ä¢ What is the company‚Äôs technology stack? What existing services you might leverage to simplify the design?
```
```
<Example>
If you are asked to design a news feed system, you want to ask questions that help you clarify the requirements.
The conversation between you and the interviewer might look like this:

Candidate: Is this a mobile app? Or a web app? Or both?
Interviewer: Both.
Candidate: What are the most important features for the product? 
Interviewer: Ability to make a post and see friends‚Äô news feed.
Candidate: Is the news feed sorted in reverse chronological order or a particular order?
  The particular order means each post is given a different weight.
  For instance, posts from your close friends are more important than posts from a group.
Interviewer: To keep things simple, let us assume the feed is sorted by reverse chronological order.
Candidate: How many friends can a user have? 
Interviewer: 5000
Candidate: What is the traffic volume?
Interviewer: 10 million daily active users (DAU)
Candidate: Can feed contain images, videos, or just text?
Interviewer: It can contain media files, including both images and videos.

```
Above are some sample questions that you can ask your interviewer. 
It is important to understand the requirements and clarify ambiguities

#### Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in
In this step, we aim to develop a high-level design and reach an agreement with the interviewer on the design. 
```
üòâ It is a great idea to collaborate with the interviewer during the process.
  ‚Ä¢ Come up with an initial blueprint for the design. Ask for feedback.
    Treat your interviewer as a teammate and work together.
    Many good interviewers love to talk and get involved.
  ‚Ä¢ Draw box diagrams with key components on the whiteboard or paper.
    This might include clients (mobile/web), APIs, web servers, data stores, cache, CDN, message queue, etc.
  ‚Ä¢ Do back-of-the-envelope calculations to evaluate if your blueprint fits the scale constraints.
    Think out loud. Communicate with your interviewer if back-of-the-envelope is necessary before diving into it.

If possible, go through a few concrete use cases.
This will help you frame the high-level design.
It is also likely that the use cases would help you discover edge cases you have not yet considered.

Should we include API endpoints and database schema here?
  This depends on the problem.
  For large design problems like ‚ÄúDesign Google search engine‚Äù, this is a bit of too low level. 
  For a problem like designing the backend for a multi-player poker game, this is a fair game.

Communicate with your interviewer.
```

```
<Example>
Let us use ‚ÄúDesign a news feed system‚Äù to demonstrate how to approach the high-level design.
Here you are not required to understand how the system actually works. 
All the details will be explained in Chapter 11.

At the high level, the design is divided into two flows: feed publishing and news feed building.
‚Ä¢ Feed publishing:
    when a user publishes a post, corresponding data is written into cache/database,
    and the post will be populated into friends‚Äô news feed.
‚Ä¢ Newsfeed building:
    the news feed is built by aggregating friends‚Äô posts in a reverse chronological order.

Figure 3-1 and Figure 3-2 present high-level designs for feed publishing and news feed building flows, respectively.
