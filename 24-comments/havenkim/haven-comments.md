# Comments

Comments are very useful fragments of code. They indicate the direction where the code should go.

The main goal we should pursue is to write a self-describing code, which is easy to understand, easy to reuse and easy to follow the flow of surrounding components.

Or just leave a comment for other people or when you aren't sure about the code. So that it works as a footprint of struggles and solutions.
